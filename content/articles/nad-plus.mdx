The compound's biological activity is typically evaluated through in vitro assays and ex vivo tissue studies, providing insights into its potential research applications. NAD+ serves as a critical cofactor in numerous enzymatic reactions, including:

- Oxidoreductase reactions: NAD+ acts as an electron acceptor in oxidation-reduction reactions, converting to NADH and back, facilitating energy transfer in metabolic pathways
- Sirtuin activation: NAD+ is required for the activity of sirtuin enzymes (SIRT1-7), which are involved in gene silencing, DNA repair, and longevity pathways
- DNA repair mechanisms: NAD+ is consumed in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) reactions during DNA damage repair
- Mitochondrial function: NAD+ is essential for mitochondrial energy production through the electron transport chain

The stability of NAD+ (shelf life: 24 months) is an important consideration for laboratory research. Proper storage and handling are essential to maintain the compound's biological activity and structural integrity throughout experimental procedures. Researchers typically assess the compound's stability under various conditions, including temperature, pH, and storage duration, to ensure reliable experimental results. NAD+ is particularly sensitive to light and should be protected from direct exposure to maintain its biological activity.

The biological function of NAD+ in research contexts involves its interaction with cellular targets related to energy metabolism and cellular maintenance. Laboratory studies have investigated the coenzyme's effects on:
- Cellular energy production and ATP generation
- Gene expression regulation through sirtuin-mediated pathways
- DNA repair and genomic stability
- Cellular senescence and aging processes
- Metabolic regulation and glucose homeostasis

Understanding these interactions helps researchers design experiments to investigate specific biological processes and pathways related to cellular metabolism, aging, and disease mechanisms.

## Chemical Background

NAD+ has the chemical formula C21H27N7O14P2 with a molar mass of 663.43 g/mol. The CAS registry number is 53-84-9. The compound is also known by the following synonyms: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NAD, Coenzyme I, DPN. Additional chemical information can be found in PubChem (ID: 5892). The structural properties of NAD+ contribute to its biological activity and research applications.

NAD+ consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine base and the other contains nicotinamide. The molecule exists in two forms: NAD+ (oxidized) and NADH (reduced), which interconvert during metabolic reactions. This redox cycling is fundamental to cellular energy metabolism and makes NAD+ a critical component of numerous biochemical pathways.

The structural characteristics of NAD+ allow it to function as a coenzyme in a wide variety of enzymatic reactions. Its ability to accept and donate electrons makes it essential for energy transfer processes in cells, including those occurring in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.

Researchers working with NAD+ should follow established laboratory protocols, maintain sterile conditions during reconstitution and handling, and adhere to all safety guidelines. Proper documentation of experimental procedures, storage conditions, and handling protocols is essential for research reproducibility and scientific rigor. The coenzyme's sensitivity to light and its role in critical cellular processes make careful handling particularly important for reliable experimental results.

## Handling and Storage Guidelines

Storage Requirements:
Store lyophilized powder at -20°C in a dry environment. Protect from light, air, and moisture. Reconstituted solution should be stored at 4°C and used promptly. Maintain sterile conditions during reconstitution.

Handling Guidelines:
Handle using sterile techniques and appropriate laboratory personal protective equipment (PPE). Use in well-ventilated areas. Avoid inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact. NAD+ is sensitive to light and should be protected from direct exposure. Follow standard laboratory safety protocols. Refer to Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for complete safety information.

Shelf Life:
24 months when stored properly as lyophilized powder under recommended conditions (-20°C, dry environment, protected from light, air, and moisture).

Reconstitution Notes:
When reconstituting NAD+, use sterile water or appropriate buffer solutions. Maintain sterile conditions throughout the reconstitution process. Store reconstituted solutions at 4°C and use promptly to minimize degradation. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, as this may affect coenzyme stability and biological activity. Protect reconstituted solutions from light exposure.

Light Sensitivity:
NAD+ is particularly sensitive to light and should be protected from direct exposure during storage, handling, and experimental use. Use amber containers or wrap containers in foil to protect from light. Work in low-light conditions when possible to maintain coenzyme integrity.



NAD+ represents an essential research coenzyme for investigating cellular metabolism, energy production, and aging mechanisms.
