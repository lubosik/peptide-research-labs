## Chemical Background

The Cagrilintide and Semaglutide combination is a dual hormone peptide formulation consisting of Cagrilintide (an amylin analog) and Semaglutide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist). The combination is also known by the following synonyms: Cagrilintide + Semaglutide, AM833 + Semaglutide. The structural properties of this combination contribute to its function as a dual hormone formulation for metabolic regulation and weight management research applications.

Cagrilintide is an amylin analog that functions similarly to the natural hormone amylin, which is co-secreted with insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that functions similarly to the natural hormone GLP-1, which is secreted from intestinal L cells. The combination of these two peptide hormones provides synergistic effects on glucose homeostasis, appetite control, and weight management through their complementary mechanisms of action.

The composition of this combination includes:
- Chemical formula: Combination product
- Molar mass: Variable
- CAS Number: N/A
