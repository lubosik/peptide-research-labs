AICAR is used in laboratory research to investigate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and metabolic regulation. Research applications include studies on metabolic pathways, energy metabolism, glucose homeostasis, AMPK signaling, and metabolic syndrome in experimental models. The compound falls within the Others category and serves as a valuable research tool for metabolic regulation investigations and scientific research applications.

The nucleotide analog has been investigated for its potential role in laboratory research settings, where it may be used to study various metabolic and cellular processes. Laboratory researchers utilize AICAR to investigate AMPK activation, metabolic pathways, and experimental models that contribute to scientific understanding of metabolic regulation and energy homeostasis.

## Mechanism of Action

AICAR functions as a nucleotide analog that activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through its conversion to ZMP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide monophosphate), which mimics the effects of AMP on AMPK. The compound has been studied for its potential applications in metabolic regulation, energy metabolism, and glucose homeostasis research. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for laboratory researchers investigating metabolic and cellular processes.

One of the primary mechanisms involves AMPK activation through ZMP accumulation. AICAR has been shown in laboratory studies to be taken up by cells and phosphorylated to ZMP, which activates AMPK by binding to the gamma subunit of the kinase complex. The compound may be used to study AMPK-dependent metabolic pathways, including effects on glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis. This application is particularly relevant for research into metabolic regulation and energy homeostasis.

The compound also influences metabolic pathways through AMPK-mediated effects on cellular energy status. AICAR has been shown in laboratory studies to be useful for investigating metabolic regulation, including effects on glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and protein synthesis. The compound may affect various metabolic processes, including effects on glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid synthesis. Laboratory researchers investigate how the compound may influence metabolic pathways and cellular energy balance.

Energy metabolism research involves the use of AICAR in various experimental systems to investigate metabolic regulation and energy homeostasis. The compound may be used in in vitro, ex vivo, and whole-animal models to study its effects on metabolic pathways and energy metabolism. Laboratory researchers investigate how AICAR may influence metabolic outcomes and contribute to scientific understanding of metabolic regulation.

The stability of AICAR (shelf life: 36 months) is an important consideration for laboratory research. Proper storage and handling are essential to maintain the compound's properties and structural integrity throughout experimental procedures. Researchers typically assess the compound's stability under various conditions, including temperature, pH, light exposure, and storage duration, to ensure reliable experimental results.

AICAR is a purine nucleotide analog that is structurally similar to AMP, allowing it to activate AMPK through conversion to ZMP. The compound consists of a ribose sugar, a phosphate group, and an aminoimidazole carboxamide base. This structure enables AICAR to be taken up by cells and phosphorylated to ZMP, which then activates AMPK by binding to the gamma subunit of the kinase complex.

The composition of AICAR includes:
- Chemical formula: C9H15N4O8P
- Molar mass: 338.21 g/mol
- CAS Number: 3031-94-5
- PubChem ID: 17513
- Nucleotide analog structure: Similar to AMP with aminoimidazole carboxamide base
- ZMP precursor: Converted to ZMP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide monophosphate) in cells

The nucleotide analog nature of AICAR makes it valuable for AMPK activation and metabolic regulation research. The compound's ability to be converted to ZMP and activate AMPK allows researchers to study metabolic pathways and energy homeostasis in controlled experimental settings.
