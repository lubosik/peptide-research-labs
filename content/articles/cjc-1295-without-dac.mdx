## Introduction

CJC-1295 without DAC, commonly referred to as CJC, CJC1295, or Modified GRF (1-29) in research communities, represents a synthetic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) analog that has been extensively studied for its potential effects on growth hormone secretion and pituitary function. This modified version of growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) lacks the drug affinity complex (DAC) modification, resulting in a shorter-acting peptide compared to the DAC version. Laboratory researchers utilize CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) to investigate growth hormone release, pulsatile GH secretion patterns, growth factor modulation, and pituitary function in experimental models. The compound falls within the Hormones / Growth Factors / Bodybuilding category and serves as a valuable research tool for understanding GHRH mechanisms and growth hormone regulation.

CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) is used in laboratory research to investigate growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) activity. Research applications include studies on growth hormone secretion, pulsatile GH release patterns, growth factor modulation, and pituitary function in experimental models. The compound has been investigated for its potential role in stimulating growth hormone release from the pituitary gland, modulating pulsatile GH secretion patterns, and influencing growth factor production. These investigations contribute to the broader understanding of growth hormone regulation and may inform future research directions in endocrinology and growth factor research.

The peptide analog has been studied extensively in laboratory settings for its effects on pituitary somatotroph cells and growth hormone secretion. Researchers investigate CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) to understand how this GHRH analog may influence growth hormone release, GH pulse patterns, and growth factor modulation. These studies contribute to understanding GHRH receptor signaling and may provide insights into growth hormone and growth factor research applications.

## Mechanism of Action

CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) functions through interactions with growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) receptors on pituitary somatotroph cells, leading to growth hormone secretion. The compound's mechanism of action involves GHRH receptor activation, growth hormone release stimulation, and modulation of pulsatile GH secretion patterns. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for laboratory researchers investigating growth hormone regulation and pituitary function.

One of the primary mechanisms involves GHRH receptor activation on pituitary somatotroph cells. CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) binds to GHRH receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors expressed on pituitary somatotroph cells. Receptor activation leads to intracellular signaling cascades that stimulate growth hormone synthesis and release. This mechanism is particularly relevant for research into growth hormone secretion, pituitary function, and GHRH receptor signaling. Laboratory studies investigate how CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) may influence GHRH receptor binding affinity, activation, and downstream signaling events.

The compound also influences growth hormone secretion through effects on somatotroph cell function. CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) has been shown in laboratory studies to stimulate growth hormone release from pituitary somatotroph cells. The peptide analog may enhance growth hormone synthesis, storage, and secretion processes. Laboratory researchers investigate how the compound may influence growth hormone gene expression, protein synthesis, and release mechanisms in somatotroph cells.

Pulsatile GH secretion modulation represents another important mechanism of action. CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) has been studied for its potential to modulate pulsatile growth hormone secretion patterns. The compound may influence GH pulse amplitude, frequency, and overall pulsatile secretion characteristics. Laboratory studies have investigated how CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) may affect the natural pulsatile pattern of growth hormone release, which is important for growth hormone's biological effects. These effects are relevant for research into growth hormone regulation and pulsatile hormone secretion.

Somatostatin inhibition effects may also contribute to the compound's mechanism of action. CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) may influence the balance between GHRH and somatostatin, which are the primary regulators of growth hormone secretion. The compound may reduce somatostatin's inhibitory effects on growth hormone release, contributing to enhanced GH secretion. This mechanism is relevant for research into growth hormone regulation and pituitary hormone interactions.

Growth factor modulation involves effects on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and other growth factors. CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) may influence growth factor production through its effects on growth hormone secretion, as GH stimulates IGF-1 production in various tissues. Laboratory researchers investigate how the compound may affect growth factor levels and activity through growth hormone-dependent and independent mechanisms.

The stability of CJC-1295 without DAC (CJC, CJC1295) (shelf life: 36 months) is an important consideration for laboratory research. Proper storage and handling are essential to maintain the compound's biological activity and structural integrity throughout experimental procedures. Researchers typically assess the compound's stability under various conditions, including temperature, pH, and storage duration, to ensure reliable experimental results.
