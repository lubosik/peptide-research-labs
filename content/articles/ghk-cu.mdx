## Introduction

GHK-Cu, commonly referred to as GHK or copper peptide in research communities, represents a naturally occurring copper-binding tripeptide compound that has been extensively studied since its initial isolation from human plasma in 1973. This compound, also known as Copper Tripeptide-1, Glycyl-L-Histidyl-L-Lysine Copper, or Cu-GHK, serves as a valuable research tool for investigating tissue regeneration, wound healing mechanisms, collagen synthesis stimulation, and gene expression modulation. Laboratory researchers utilize GHK-Cu (GHK) to study copper-dependent biological processes, antioxidant defense mechanisms, anti-inflammatory effects, and hair growth stimulation in experimental models. The compound falls within the Repair / Healing / Anti-inflammatory category and has been the subject of numerous laboratory investigations.

GHK-Cu (GHK) is extensively studied in laboratory research for its potential effects on tissue regeneration and repair mechanisms. Research applications include investigations into collagen synthesis stimulation through copper-dependent enzyme activation, wound healing acceleration through enhanced angiogenesis and fibroblast activation, anti-inflammatory effects through suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, antioxidant defense through superoxide dismutase mimetic activity, hair growth stimulation through Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, and gene expression modulation affecting over 4,000 human genes. The compound's broad spectrum of research applications makes it particularly valuable for studying multiple aspects of tissue repair and regeneration.

The peptide has been investigated for its potential role in promoting healing across various tissue types, including skin, hair follicles, and connective tissues. Researchers study GHK-Cu (GHK) to understand how this copper-binding peptide may influence collagen production, extracellular matrix composition, cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and gene expression patterns. These investigations contribute to the broader understanding of tissue repair mechanisms and may inform future research directions in regenerative medicine and anti-aging studies.

## Mechanism of Action

GHK-Cu (GHK) functions through multiple interconnected mechanisms that contribute to its research applications in tissue regeneration and repair. The compound's mechanism of action involves copper-dependent processes, gene expression modulation, and interactions with various cellular signaling pathways that influence tissue repair, inflammation, and cellular function. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for laboratory researchers investigating tissue regeneration and cytoprotection pathways.

One of the primary mechanisms involves collagen synthesis stimulation through copper-dependent enzyme activation. GHK-Cu (GHK) provides copper ions that serve as essential cofactors for lysyl oxidase, an enzyme critical for collagen cross-linking and maturation. Laboratory studies have shown that GHK-Cu may enhance collagen production by activating copper-dependent enzymes involved in collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix formation. This mechanism is particularly relevant for research into wound healing, tissue regeneration, and connective tissue repair. Researchers investigate how copper-dependent enzyme activation contributes to improved tissue strength, integrity, and healing quality.

The compound also influences gene expression modulation, affecting over 4,000 human genes according to laboratory research. GHK-Cu (GHK) has been shown to modulate the expression of genes involved in tissue repair, inflammation, antioxidant defense, and cellular function. This broad gene expression modulation may contribute to the compound's diverse research applications, including tissue regeneration, anti-inflammatory effects, and cellular protection. Laboratory researchers investigate how gene expression changes may influence various aspects of tissue repair and cellular function.

Wound healing acceleration represents another important mechanism of action. GHK-Cu (GHK) has been studied for its potential to enhance wound healing through multiple pathways, including enhanced angiogenesis, fibroblast activation, and extracellular matrix production. Laboratory studies have investigated how the compound may promote blood vessel formation, stimulate fibroblast proliferation and activity, and enhance tissue remodeling processes. These effects are particularly relevant for research into wound healing, tissue regeneration, and repair mechanisms.

Anti-inflammatory effects involve suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulation of inflammatory responses. GHK-Cu (GHK) has been shown in laboratory studies to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines while potentially promoting anti-inflammatory mediators. This mechanism is relevant for research into inflammatory conditions, tissue repair in inflammatory environments, and cytoprotection. Researchers investigate how anti-inflammatory effects may contribute to improved healing outcomes and reduced tissue damage.

Antioxidant defense mechanisms involve superoxide dismutase mimetic activity. GHK-Cu (GHK) may function as a superoxide dismutase mimetic, helping to neutralize reactive oxygen species and protect cells from oxidative damage. This mechanism is particularly relevant for research into oxidative stress, cellular protection, and age-related processes. Laboratory researchers investigate how antioxidant effects may contribute to tissue protection and improved healing outcomes.

Hair growth stimulation mechanisms involve activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. GHK-Cu (GHK) has been studied for its potential to stimulate hair growth through effects on Wnt signaling and β-catenin activation, which are important pathways for hair follicle development and cycling. Laboratory studies investigate how the compound may influence hair follicle function, hair growth cycles, and hair quality. These effects make GHK-Cu (GHK) valuable for research into hair biology and hair growth mechanisms.

The stability of GHK-Cu (GHK) (shelf life: 36 months) is an important consideration for laboratory research. Proper storage and handling are essential to maintain the compound's biological activity and structural integrity throughout experimental procedures. The compound may form blue to purple colored solutions due to copper(II) complexation, which is a normal characteristic of the copper-peptide complex. Researchers typically assess the compound's stability under various conditions, including temperature, pH, and storage duration, to ensure reliable experimental results.
