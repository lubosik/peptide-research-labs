These studies contribute to understanding long-acting peptide mechanisms and may provide insights into sustained growth hormone and growth factor research applications.

## Mechanism of Action

CJC-1295 with DAC (CJC DAC, CJC1295 DAC) functions through interactions with growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) receptors on pituitary somatotroph cells, similar to the version without DAC, but with significantly extended duration of action due to the drug affinity complex (DAC) modification. The compound's mechanism of action involves GHRH receptor activation, sustained growth hormone release stimulation, and prolonged modulation of GH secretion patterns. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for laboratory researchers investigating sustained growth hormone regulation and long-acting peptide effects.

One of the primary mechanisms involves GHRH receptor activation with extended duration. CJC-1295 with DAC (CJC DAC, CJC1295 DAC) binds to GHRH receptors on pituitary somatotroph cells, similar to the version without DAC, but the DAC modification allows the peptide to bind to serum albumin, significantly extending its half-life and duration of action. This extended binding allows for sustained receptor activation and prolonged growth hormone secretion. This mechanism is particularly relevant for research into sustained growth hormone secretion, prolonged GH release, and long-acting peptide effects. Laboratory studies investigate how CJC-1295 with DAC (CJC DAC, CJC1295 DAC) may provide extended GHRH receptor activation compared to shorter-acting versions.

The compound also influences sustained growth hormone secretion through prolonged effects on somatotroph cell function. CJC-1295 with DAC (CJC DAC, CJC1295 DAC) has been shown in laboratory studies to provide sustained growth hormone release from pituitary somatotroph cells over extended periods. The long-acting nature of the compound allows for continuous stimulation of growth hormone synthesis, storage, and secretion processes. Laboratory researchers investigate how the compound may maintain elevated growth hormone levels and provide sustained GH secretion compared to shorter-acting peptides.

Extended GH release patterns represent another important mechanism of action. CJC-1295 with DAC (CJC DAC, CJC1295 DAC) has been studied for its potential to provide extended growth hormone release patterns, maintaining elevated GH levels over prolonged periods. The compound may influence GH secretion for extended durations, potentially providing more sustained growth hormone effects compared to pulsatile or short-acting versions. Laboratory studies have investigated how CJC-1295 with DAC (CJC DAC, CJC1295 DAC) may affect growth hormone levels over time, providing sustained rather than pulsatile GH release.

Sustained growth factor modulation involves prolonged effects on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and other growth factors. CJC-1295 with DAC (CJC DAC, CJC1295 DAC) may provide sustained growth factor production through its extended effects on growth hormone secretion, as GH stimulates IGF-1 production in various tissues. The long-acting nature of the compound may allow for sustained growth factor modulation over extended periods. Laboratory researchers investigate how the compound may affect growth factor levels and activity through sustained growth hormone-dependent mechanisms.

Drug affinity complex (DAC) mechanism involves binding to serum albumin, which extends the peptide's half-life. The DAC modification allows CJC-1295 with DAC (CJC DAC, CJC1295 DAC) to bind reversibly to serum albumin, protecting the peptide from degradation and extending its circulation time. This mechanism is what distinguishes the DAC version from the version without DAC, providing significantly extended duration of action. Laboratory researchers investigate how the DAC modification affects peptide stability, half-life, and biological activity duration.

The stability of CJC-1295 with DAC (CJC DAC, CJC1295 DAC) (shelf life: 36 months) is an important consideration for laboratory research.
