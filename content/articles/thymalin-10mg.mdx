The compound's role in immune function makes careful handling particularly important for maintaining biological activity and ensuring reliable experimental results.

## Handling and Storage Guidelines

Storage Requirements: Store lyophilized powder at -20°C in a dry environment. Protect from light and moisture. Reconstituted solution should be stored at 4°C for up to 14 days. Maintain sterile conditions during reconstitution.

Handling Guidelines: Handle using sterile techniques and appropriate laboratory personal protective equipment (PPE). Use in well-ventilated areas. Avoid inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact. Follow standard laboratory safety protocols. Refer to Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for complete safety information.

Shelf Life: 36 months when stored properly as lyophilized powder under recommended conditions (-20°C, dry environment, protected from light and moisture).

Reconstitution Notes: When reconstituting Thymalin, use sterile water or appropriate buffer solutions. Maintain sterile conditions throughout the reconstitution process. Store reconstituted solutions at 4°C and use within 14 days. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, as this may affect peptide stability and biological activity. Protect reconstituted solutions from light exposure.

Temperature Sensitivity: Thymalin should be stored at -20°C to maintain peptide stability and biological activity. Avoid exposure to higher temperatures that could denature the peptides or reduce their biological activity. When working with the preparation, minimize time at room temperature and return to appropriate storage conditions promptly.
