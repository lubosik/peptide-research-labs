Researchers investigate how AOD9604 modulates cellular signaling, receptor binding, and downstream biochemical cascades in experimental models. The compound's biological activity is typically evaluated through in vitro assays and ex vivo tissue studies, providing insights into its potential research applications. AOD9604 functions through several key mechanisms:

- Growth hormone receptor interaction: Interacts with growth hormone receptors, but unlike full-length HGH, AOD9604 appears to selectively activate metabolic pathways without the full spectrum of HGH effects
- Lipolysis promotion: Stimulates lipolysis (fat breakdown) in adipose tissue through activation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and other lipolytic enzymes
- Fat metabolism regulation: Modulates fat metabolism pathways, including fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride breakdown
- Adipose tissue effects: Influences adipose tissue function, including fat cell metabolism and lipid storage
- Metabolic rate modulation: May influence metabolic rate and energy expenditure through effects on fat metabolism
- Weight management mechanisms: Supports weight management through effects on fat metabolism, lipolysis, and energy balance

The stability of AOD9604 (shelf life: 36 months) is an important consideration for laboratory research. Proper storage and handling are essential to maintain the compound's biological activity and structural integrity throughout experimental procedures. Researchers typically assess the compound's stability under various conditions, including temperature, pH, and storage duration, to ensure reliable experimental results. The peptide should be stored at -20°C in a dry environment and protected from light and moisture to maintain biological activity.

The biological function of AOD9604 in research contexts involves its interaction with cellular targets related to fat metabolism and metabolic regulation. Laboratory studies have investigated the compound's effects on:
- Lipolysis and fat breakdown in adipose tissue
- Fatty acid oxidation and fat metabolism pathways
- Adipose tissue function and lipid storage
- Metabolic rate and energy expenditure
- Weight management and energy balance
- Metabolic syndrome-related processes

Understanding these interactions helps researchers design experiments to investigate specific biological processes and pathways related to fat metabolism, lipolysis, and weight management mechanisms.

## Chemical Background

AOD9604 has the chemical formula C78H123N21O20S with a molar mass of 1814.0 g/mol. The CAS registry number is 221231-10-3. The compound is also known by the following synonyms: AOD9604, HGH Fragment 176-191, Modified HGH (176-191). Additional chemical information can be found in PubChem (ID: 16129792). The structural properties of AOD9604 contribute to its biological activity and research applications.

AOD9604 is a 16-amino acid peptide fragment corresponding to amino acids 176-191 of human growth hormone. The compound represents a modified version of this HGH fragment, designed to retain the metabolic and lipolytic properties of the parent hormone while potentially avoiding some of the full HGH effects. The structural characteristics of the peptide allow it to interact with growth hormone receptors and influence fat metabolism pathways.

The structural characteristics of AOD9604 allow it to function as a selective growth hormone fragment. The peptide's ability to interact with growth hormone receptors and influence fat metabolism makes it valuable for research into lipolysis, fat metabolism, and weight management mechanisms.
