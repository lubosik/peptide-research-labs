These studies contribute to understanding long-acting growth factor mechanisms and may provide insights into growth factor and tissue regeneration research applications.

## Mechanism of Action

IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) functions through interactions with insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors (IGF-1R) and insulin receptors (IR) on various cell types, similar to native IGF-1, but with significantly enhanced bioavailability and prolonged duration of action due to reduced binding to IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). The compound's mechanism of action involves IGF-1 receptor activation, growth factor signaling pathway stimulation, and modulation of cellular proliferation, protein synthesis, and metabolic processes. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for laboratory researchers investigating growth factor regulation and cellular growth processes.

One of the primary mechanisms involves IGF-1 receptor activation with enhanced bioavailability. IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) binds to IGF-1 receptors on target cells, activating intracellular signaling pathways including the PI3K/AKT pathway and the MAPK/ERK pathway. The R3 modification and N-terminal extension reduce binding to IGF-binding proteins, allowing more free IGF-1LR3 to be available for receptor binding compared to native IGF-1. This enhanced bioavailability results in more potent and prolonged receptor activation. This mechanism is particularly relevant for research into growth factor signaling, cellular proliferation, and tissue growth. Laboratory studies investigate how IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) may provide enhanced growth factor signaling compared to native IGF-1.

The compound also influences cellular proliferation through growth factor signaling pathways. IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) has been shown in laboratory studies to stimulate cellular proliferation in various cell types through activation of IGF-1 receptor signaling. The compound activates intracellular signaling cascades that promote cell cycle progression, DNA synthesis, and cellular division. Laboratory researchers investigate how the compound may influence cellular growth and proliferation in different tissue types and experimental models.

Muscle growth mechanisms represent another important area of research. IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) has been studied for its potential to promote muscle growth through multiple mechanisms, including enhanced protein synthesis, satellite cell activation, and muscle fiber hypertrophy. The compound may stimulate muscle protein synthesis through activation of mTOR signaling pathways, leading to increased protein translation and muscle growth. Laboratory studies have investigated how IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) may affect muscle growth, protein synthesis, and muscle regeneration in experimental models.

Protein synthesis enhancement involves activation of anabolic signaling pathways. IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) may promote protein synthesis through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which plays a central role in regulating protein translation and cellular growth. The compound's enhanced bioavailability may result in more sustained activation of these pathways compared to native IGF-1. Laboratory researchers investigate how the compound may affect protein synthesis rates, muscle protein balance, and overall anabolic processes.

Tissue regeneration mechanisms involve promotion of cellular growth and repair processes. IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) may support tissue regeneration through stimulation of cellular proliferation, enhancement of wound healing processes, and promotion of tissue repair mechanisms. The compound's growth factor properties make it valuable for research into tissue engineering, wound healing, and regenerative medicine applications. Laboratory studies investigate how IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) may influence tissue regeneration and repair processes.

Metabolic process modulation involves effects on glucose metabolism and nutrient utilization. IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) may influence metabolic processes through insulin-like effects on glucose uptake and utilization, as well as through growth factor effects on cellular metabolism. The compound may enhance glucose uptake in muscle and other tissues, potentially influencing overall metabolic function. Laboratory researchers investigate how IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) may affect metabolic processes and nutrient utilization.

Reduced IGFBP binding represents a key mechanism that distinguishes IGF-1LR3 from native IGF-1. The R3 modification and N-terminal extension reduce the compound's affinity for IGF-binding proteins, which normally sequester IGF-1 and limit its bioavailability. This reduced binding allows more free IGF-1LR3 to be available for receptor activation, resulting in enhanced biological activity and prolonged duration of action. Laboratory researchers investigate how this mechanism affects the compound's pharmacokinetics and biological effects.

The stability of IGF-1LR3 (IGF-1 Long R3, Long R3 IGF-1) (shelf life: 36 months) is an important consideration for laboratory research. Proper storage and handling are essential to maintain the compound's biological activity and structural integrity throughout experimental procedures. Researchers typically assess the compound's stability under various conditions, including temperature, pH, and storage duration, to ensure reliable experimental results.
