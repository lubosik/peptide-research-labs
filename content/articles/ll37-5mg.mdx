## Mechanism of Action

LL-37 (LL37) functions through multiple interconnected mechanisms that contribute to its research applications in antimicrobial activity and immune function. The compound's mechanism of action involves direct antimicrobial effects, immune modulation, wound healing promotion, and inflammatory response regulation. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for laboratory researchers investigating antimicrobial peptide mechanisms and innate immunity.

One of the primary mechanisms involves direct antimicrobial activity through bacterial membrane disruption. LL-37 (LL37) has been shown in laboratory studies to kill bacteria by disrupting bacterial cell membranes through electrostatic interactions and membrane permeabilization.
