Selling Research Peptides Online – Compliance &
Website Guidelines
Overview:  Selling peptides as “for research use only” (RUO) in the U.S. requires careful compliance with
FDA and state laws. Peptides not FDA-approved for human or animal use cannot  be marketed as drugs
or supplements, and sites must avoid any health/fitness claims. Instead, the website must emphasize
laboratory  research  use,  include  strict  disclaimers,  and  follow  legal  requirements  (age  verification,
terms of sale, privacy, etc.). The following guidelines cover what to do and not do  on a peptide sales
site:
Regulatory Status of Peptides in the USA
Unapproved  Drugs:  Most  research  peptides  (e.g.  BPC-157,  CJC-1295,  GHK-Cu)  are  not FDA-
approved for human or animal use. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act),
selling any compound as a therapeutic without FDA approval is illegal . Peptides labeled “for
research  only”  are  considered  unapproved  drugs  if  evidence  shows  they  are  intended  for
human use .
RUO  Classification:  Peptides  marketed  as  “for  research  use  only”  or  “not  for  human
consumption” are meant strictly for laboratory and experimental purposes . Legally, this
means they can be sold to qualified researchers and institutions, but not administered to people
or pets . Any human use or medical claim places the product in a misbranded/adulterated
category under FDA law.
Controlled Substances & Supplements:  Some peptides (like growth-hormone analogs) may be
banned  by  agencies  (DEA,  WADA)  when  used  by  athletes,  and  are  certainly  not  “dietary
supplements” under DSHEA . Synthetic peptides cannot be lawfully sold as nutrition or
health supplements – doing so violates FDA regulations .
FDA and Federal Compliance
Avoid  Medical  Claims:  The  FDA  strictly  forbids  marketing  unapproved  peptides  for  any
therapeutic use. This means  no claims  that peptides improve muscle growth, repair injuries,
burn fat, or treat any condition. Even stating known brand uses (e.g. Ozempic for diabetes) is
illegal . Marketing language must focus on research context  only.
Disclaimers  Are  Mandatory:  Every  product  page  and  label  must  state  that  items  are  for
“laboratory research purposes only,” and explicitly “not for human or veterinary use” .
This includes labeling on the website, product pages, and any packaging or certificates. The site
should also note that products are not FDA-approved . Example text from existing vendors:
“All products sold on this website… are intended strictly for laboratory research purposes only.
They  are  not  for  human  consumption,  not  for  medical  use,  not  for  veterinary  use…  These
products are not approved by the FDA.”•

1“All products sold by [Company] are for laboratory research purposes only. They are not intended
for human or animal use, and must not be used in drugs, cosmetics, or any products intended
for ingestion, injection, or topical application.”
No  Instruction  or  Dosage:  The  site  must  not  provide  dosing  instructions,  administration
advice, or imply safe use in humans. Product descriptions should simply identify the peptide and
cite scientific or lab research contexts, without indicating it’s safe or effective for people. Even
aside from FDA rules, giving medical advice without credentials can violate state practice laws.
No Bundling with Drug Accessories:  Don’t offer needles, syringes, or other drug paraphernalia
alongside peptides. The FDA has warned that selling peptides with diluents or injection kits is
evidence of intent for human use , inviting enforcement.
State-Level Restrictions (Age & Marketing)
Age Restrictions:  A new New York law (effective April 2025) prohibits  selling muscle-building or
weight-loss products to anyone under 18 . Several other states (NJ, CA, IL, etc.) have
similar or pending laws requiring parental consent or banning such sales to minors . Even
if labeled RUO, peptides sold for “performance enhancement” fall under these laws. 
Action:  Implement an age gate or age verification system. Require customers to confirm they
are 18+ and are purchasing strictly for legitimate laboratory use before accessing the store
.
Marketing Language:  State enforcement focuses on  marketing  as much as product content.
Avoid  phrases  like  “muscle  growth,”  “fat  loss,”  “lean  mass,”  “GH  boost,”  or  “recovery
enhancer” . These are red flags that can trigger regulator scrutiny. Instead, describe peptides
in neutral scientific terms (e.g. “growth hormone–releasing peptide studied in lab research,”
“cosmetic peptide for collagen research,” etc.), and always attach the RUO disclaimer . Carefully
review SEO keywords to ensure they don’t promise human benefits.
Location Filtering:  Consider geofencing or disclaimers for states with strict laws. At minimum,
the  site’s  legal  pages  should  acknowledge  that  customers  are  responsible  for  ensuring
compliance with their local laws .
Website Disclaimers & Pop-ups
Research-Only Pop-up:  On entry or checkout, use a pop-up or modal that requires the user to
click “I agree” after confirming they are over 18 and understand the research-use-only terms
. For example: “All products are for scientific research use only. You must be 18+ and not
purchasing  for  human  or  animal  use.  By  clicking  ‘I  Agree’,  you  confirm  understanding  and
acceptance of our terms.” This explicitly records user consent.
Key Disclaimers to Display:
“For Research Use Only – Not for Human or Veterinary Use.”  This should appear prominently on
product pages and checkout pages . 
“Not a Medical Product.”  Clarify that items are not medical treatments and the site is not a
pharmacy . •

2“Not Approved by FDA.”  Inform customers that none of these products are FDA-approved and are
sold only for laboratory study . 
“No Warranty & Use at Own Risk.”  State that the company assumes no liability for misuse (e.g. “We
do not assume responsibility for misuse or mishandling. Use at your own risk” ). 
Safety & Handling:  Encourage safe lab practices. For example: “By purchasing, you affirm you
are a qualified researcher and understand the risks and handling requirements associated with
these materials” . Offer (or link to) Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and handling
guidelines  for  each  peptide .  Mention  that  improper  use  can  cause  injury  or  death ,
underscoring seriousness.
International & Local Laws:  If selling cross-border , add a note that customers must comply with
their local import and research laws. (Some sellers explicitly advise international customers to
check local regulations .)
Terms, Policies, and Legal Pages
Terms and Conditions:  Create a comprehensive Terms of Use page stating all legal conditions. It
should include:
The RUO clause:  E.g. “All products sold are for Research Use Only. Not intended for human or
animal use .” 
Liability Limits:  A clear statement of no warranties and liability waiver (e.g. “Seller makes no
warranties about product use; buyer assumes all risk”). Utah Lab Research says “We do not
assume any responsibility for misuse or mishandling. Use at your own risk” . 
Compliance:  “Buyer is responsible for compliance with all applicable laws” . 
Copyright/Trademark:  Standard copyright notice on content and logos. 
Governing Law:  (optional) You may specify a state law for disputes as is common in contracts.
Privacy Policy:  Standard e-commerce privacy page describing data collection and usage. (Not
peptide-specific, but legally required for any website collecting user data.)
Shipping  Policy:  Disclose  shipping  methods  (e.g.  FedEx  overnight  per  rPeptide ),  any
geographic restrictions, and import/export obligations. Clarify that peptides will be shipped with
RUO labeling.
Return/Refund Policy:  Clarify that returns are limited. Many lab suppliers do not accept returns
for opened or misused materials. E.g., rPeptide requires written notice of defects within 3 days,
then restocking fee . Utah Lab Research does not mention returns but implies risk. A safe
policy:  no  returns  on  opened  products,  only  replace  if  defective,  all  handled  at  customer’s
shipping cost.
Payment Disclaimers:  If using third-party payment processors, note that some banks may
classify  peptide  sales  as  “high  risk.”  Use  age/gender  verification  to  reduce  chargeback  risk.
(While no specific law mandates this, being aware helps avoid merchant problems .)
No Medical Advice Disclaimer:  In a FAQ or footer: “The information on this website is for
general research reference only and is not medical, legal, or nutritional advice” . Clarify that
nothing on-site should be construed as prescribing.•

3Marketing & Content Guidelines
Product Descriptions:  Focus on chemical nature and research context. E.g. “GHK-Cu (Copper
Peptide)  –  a  tripeptide  studied  for  tissue  regeneration.”  Refrain  from  any  performance  or
aesthetic claims. Instead of “promotes muscle growth,” say “supports collagen study” or “used in
wound healing experiments.” Cite peer-reviewed research neutrally if needed.
Avoid Trigger Terms:  Steer clear of any wording that could be perceived as selling a health
effect. For SEO, use terms like “laboratory peptide,” “biochemical reagent,” or “research peptide
supplier” instead of “bodybuilding peptide.” Remove any testimonials or before/after imagery of
people. 
Educational Content:  It is acceptable to include a blog or FAQ explaining what peptides are and
how  researchers  use  them—strictly  in  scientific  terms.  Any  discussion  of  benefits  should
explicitly relate to studies only . For example, “In cell studies, CJC-1295 has been shown to raise
growth  hormone  levels,”  followed  by  “This  product  is  sold  for  research  and  has  not  been
evaluated by the FDA” (to avoid implying endorsement).
Certificate of Analysis (CoA):  Although not legally required for all customers, providing third-
party testing results (CoAs) for purity can build trust and imply safety. At minimum, insist your
supplier be FDA-registered as an API manufacturer and provide CoAs . This can be mentioned
(e.g. “All batches are quality-tested with CoAs available on request”).
Pop-ups and Verification
Age/Gate Pop-up:  As noted, before accessing the catalog, use a prominent pop-up requiring
user confirmation: “I confirm I am 18 or older and purchasing solely for laboratory research. I
agree to the Terms & Disclaimers.” No one can proceed without checking.
Cookie/Consent Banners:  For GDPR and privacy compliance, display cookie consents if you
have EU traffic. (Not peptide-specific, but mandatory for any site.)
Payment Verification:  Consider adding a checkbox at checkout restating the research-only and
legal use policy. If selling to institutions, you may allow purchase orders; if selling directly to
individuals, require credit card billing checks (and possibly heighten screening to exclude minors
or high-risk buyers).
Quality and Logistics
Supplier  Vetting:  Work  only  with  reputable  chemical  manufacturers.  Ensure  the  supplier
provides clear labeling and documentation (lot numbers, CoA, SDS). Keep records of each batch’s
origin. If supplier is overseas, confirm they correctly mark contents as “Laboratory Reagents –
not for human use” on paperwork, to avoid customs issues.
Packaging & Storage:  Peptides are often shipped freeze-dried (lyophilized) in vials. Follow safe
shipping  protocols  (cool  packs  if  needed,  sturdy  packaging).  On  receiving  product,  store  as
recommended  (often  refrigerated  or  frozen).  You  may  offer  handling/storage  guidance,  but
always prefix that section with “For laboratory storage conditions only.”•

4Testing:  While not legally mandated, random third-party lab testing of your products (to verify
purity  and  identity)  is  best  practice.  This  can  also  feature  in  your  site  (e.g.  “Each  lot  is
independently verified in a lab”). It demonstrates quality assurance, though be careful to state
the limitation: “Analytical results are provided for research reference only.”
Additional Considerations
Advertising Restrictions:  Regular ad platforms (Google Ads, Facebook) usually prohibit ads for
drugs and unapproved substances. Rely on SEO/content marketing instead, but still follow their
policies. For example,  Google  disallows ads if site content suggests illegal or unsafe sale of
pharmaceuticals. Maintain a clean site with no health claims to avoid ad ban.
Legal Consultation:  Laws around peptides are evolving. It’s wise to consult a legal expert on
FDA law, especially as 2025 and beyond may bring new regulations. Keep abreast of FDA warning
letters (like recent ones against peptide sites) and guidance.
Insurance:  Consider General Liability insurance. Disclaimers help, but insurance can protect
against accidental liability claims if a product is misused.
Summary
In  summary,  sell  peptides  exclusively  as  laboratory  research  materials .  Never  imply  human  or
animal  consumption.  Use  explicit  disclaimers  (“Research  Use  Only,  Not  for  Human  Consumption”),
require  buyers  to  acknowledge  terms,  and  avoid  any  promotional  health  language.  Ensure
comprehensive legal pages (Terms & Conditions, Privacy, Shipping, etc.) that reiterate these points and
limit liability. By structuring the site with prominent warnings and keeping content strictly factual/
scientific, you minimize legal risk while still reaching your target market of researchers and labs .
Maintaining transparency and compliance — for example, posting MSDS, CoAs, and clearly labeling
every product as RUO — will help establish trust and protect your business. Even if you achieve high
SEO rankings,  compliance comes first : failing to follow these rules could lead to FDA action, state
penalties, or loss of payment/ship accounts. Implement the above measures carefully, and periodically
review them against the latest FDA and state guidance.
