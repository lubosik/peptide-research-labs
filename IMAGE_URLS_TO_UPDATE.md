The following 4 products need their `Image_URL` field updated in Airtable:

1. **5-amino-1mq**
   - Image URL: `/images/products/vici-5-amino-1mq.png`
   - File: `vici-5-amino-1mq.png`

2. **ACETIC ACID**
   - Image URL: `/images/products/vici-acetic-acid.png`
   - File: `vici-acetic-acid.png`

3. **Adipotide**
   - Image URL: `/images/products/vici-adipotide.png`
   - File: `vici-adipotide.png`

4. **AICAR**
   - Image URL: `/images/products/vici-aicar.png`

All images have been copied to `/public/images/products/` and the components have been updated to use product images from Airtable.
